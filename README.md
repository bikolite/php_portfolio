## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The main objective of the portfolio management system is to design and develop a web service that is useful for job seekers and job providers to meet. Create a portfolio website to show off your projects and achievements to prospective employers.

Here, the database is used to collect all the personal information of the candidate for generating their resume profile on the portal. The system admin will generate a report according to the company’s needs and requirements.

Here's why:
* The Portfolio Management system refers to building a strong resume for the candidate who is seeking jobs online.
* This system introduced a way of hiring employees for the organization that contains all the information of the employees and according to their skill and job requirements, they get selected for the particular post.
* The purpose of Portfolio management is the selection, prioritization, and control of an organization’s programs and projects, in line with its strategic objectives and capacity to deliver.

The world is growing digitally, and for job seekers, there are more opportunities to seek employment. This system introduced a way of hiring employees for the organization that contains all the information of the employees and according to their skill and job requirements, they get selected for the particular post.
